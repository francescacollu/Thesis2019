The study of open systems requires to solve the Liouvillian-von Neumann master equation; solving this equation means that 

\section{The Corner-Space Renormalization Method}
The numerical methods based on renormalization Ã  la Wilson present a calculation problem due to the increase of the dimensions of the Hilbert space, while the blocks are merged; the fundamental aim of the corner-space renormalization method~\cite{PhysRevLett.115.080604} is to treat this problem.

The name of this method refers to the idea of selecting a \emph{corner} of the Hilbert space for a lattice system, using eigenvectors of the steady-state density matrix of smaller lattices.

In particular, the algorithm is structured in the following stages:
\begin{description}
    \item[calculation] of the steady-state density matrix of a single block of the system;
    \item[merger] of two predetermined blocks;
    \item[expression] of the density matrix of the merged block in an orthonormal basis;
    \item[selection] of the M most probable states as a basis for the so-called \emph{corner-space};
    \item[increase] of the dimension M of the corner-space until the convergence of the observable is achieved.
\end{description}

This process has to be repeated as many times as it is needed to reach the dimensions of the system.

%In particular, let us see the steps on which the algorithm is based: 
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item determine the steady-state density matrix for small lattices, for which an exact diagonalization of the Liouville super-operator is possible;
%\item merge two lattices and select the M most probable product states as a basis for the corner space;
%\item determine the steady-state solution of the density matrix in the corner-space;
%\item increase the dimension M of the corner-space until the convergence is achieved;
%\item in order to create a larger lattice, go back to step 1.
%\end{enumerate}
