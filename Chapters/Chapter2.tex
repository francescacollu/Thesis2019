%One of the main goals in scientific research is coming up to quantum simulation; this is due to the fact that in several physical fields there are mechanisms that cannot be simulated by classical computers: the essential aim is using a controlled quantum device to investigate another quantum system. Experiments have shown that superconducting circuits are able to manipulate and measure at the level of a few qubits and microwave photons, as a quantum simulator~\cite{Nat.Phys2012}. They can be treated as open systems because of the loss of photons, coupled to the feeding in additional photons through continuous external driving. Moreover, they are greatly flexible, because of their nanofabricated nature and almost every parameter involved is widely tunable. In~\cite{PhysRevX.7.011016}, it has been demonstrated that QED cavity lattices act as a controllable platform guiding understanding of non-equilibrium physics.

\section{Basics of Dynamics}
As expressed in the previous chapter, an open quantum system can be described in terms of $\rho$, the reduced matrix given by averaging over the environment: 
\begin{equation}
    \rho_S = \Tr_E(\rho).

\section{Quantum Simulators: Controllable Many-Body Systems}
In order to overcome the problem just mentioned, over the years several analytical and numerical methods have been developed. In addition to these more "traditional" approaches, in the last years the idea of studying a quantum system by using another quantum system arose. The essential aim of this new strategy lies in the employment of controlled quantum devices called \emph{quantum simulators}; they are systems able to experimentally emulate the Hamiltonian model bearing the non-trivial properties of the system under study. The usefulness of this approach is twofold~\cite{Tomadin_Fazio}:  not only it allows to explore properties of the model in regions that are elusive to the analytical and numerical studies, but also it consents to test to which limits the Hamiltonian model is appropriate to describe the system or whether additional ingredients are required.

Since the Josephson junction arrays, that were probably the first quantum simulators in Physics History, much progress have been made especially with the advent of cold atoms in optical lattices.

\subsection{QED-Cavity Arrays}
In the last few decades the field of quantum simulators has been enriched by a new idea, based on arrays of QED cavities~\cite{Tomadin_Fazio} (sketched in fig.~\ref{fig:QED_cavities}), in which light resonates and interacts with matter contained therein.  A compelling aspect of this kind of devices is the competition between two phenomena: while on the one hand light-matter interaction inside the cavity leads to photon blockade, on the other photon hopping between neighbouring cavities favors delocalization.

QED cavities are mathematically described by the Jaynes-Cummings model~\cite{shore_knight}, in which one mode of the cavity interacts with a two-level system. Before we see how it is done, let us ignore for a moment the interaction light-matter. A single cavity confines several modes of electromagnetic field and each of them is quantized as a harmonic oscillator. If one considers a cavity with a single mode with frequency $\omega$, the Hamiltonian describing such a system can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:single_cavity}
    \mathcal{H} = \omega a^{\dagger}_la_l,
\end{equation}
where $a_l (a_l^{\dagger})$ annihilates (creates) a quantum of light in the mode of the l-th cavity.
An array of cavities sufficiently close to allow for photon hopping, can be described by eq.~\ref{eqn:single_cavity} to which the following term should be added:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{H}_{hopping} = -J (a^{\dagger}_la_l + h.c.),
\end{equation*}
where J is associated with the tunneling rate.
Now, if the light-matter interaction is introduced, the Hamiltonian can be written in this way:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H} = \sum_l \mathcal{H}_l^{(0)} - J \sum_{\langle l, l' \rangle}(a^{\dagger}_la_l + h.c.),
\end{equation}
where the term $\mathcal{H}_l^{(0)}$ describes the light-matter interaction. In particular, we want to study QED cavities so the Hamiltonian term $\mathcal{H}_l^{(0)}$ is the Jaynes-Cummings model:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Jaynes-Cummings}
    \mathcal{H}_{l,JC}^{(0)} = \varepsilon \sigma^z_l + \omega a^{\dagger}_la_l + g(\sigma^+_l a_l + \sigma^-_l a_l^{\dagger}),
\end{equation}
where $\sigma^\pm_l$ are the raising/lowering operators for the two-level system and $\varepsilon$ states the transition energy between the two levels.
The spectrum of the Hamiltonian~\ref{eqn:Jaynes-Cummings} is anharmonic, meaning the presence of the two-level system induces a repulsion between the photons in the cavity, so that in the cavity can be present only a photon at the same time. Qualitatively, this can be explained by the fact that a single photon in the cavity modifies the effective resonance frequency, so that the injection of another photon is inhibited. This phenomenon is known as \emph{photon blockade}.
