\label{Introduction}

Open quantum systems are physical systems coupled with an environment with which they exchange information. Studying the dynamics of open systems is not an easy problem, due to the complexity of the interaction between the parts involved. In order to overcome this difficulty, over the decades several analytical e numerical methods have been developed. In addition to these more "traditional" approaches, over the last decades have been investigated and advanced the field of quantum simulators: experimental platforms that reproduce Hamiltonian models analyzable with difficulty. Their advantage is the fact that the quantum simulators are quantum systems that can be insulated from the environment or with parameters easily tunable in order to replicate the model under consideration.
