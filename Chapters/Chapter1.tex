The world we live in is constituted by parts that communicate with each other and exchange information \textcolor{red}{[EXAMPLES]}. The difficulty of describing it, lies in the complexity of the interactions between those parts. To overcome these problems, simplifications and mathematical representation have been brought about in this field: in the following we will see some of them.

\section{Closed and Open Quantum Systems}
Before we explore the field of open quantum systems, let us observe what are the differences between a closed and an open quantum system and why different approaches are required to treat these two distinct kinds of system. First of all, let us define a \emph{closed} system as a physical system which does not exchange any information with its surroundings. On the contrary, an \emph{open} system is a physical system that interacts with the environment in which it is. 

In this section, we will briefly look at the different approaches in the study of the dynamics in closed and open quantum systems. 

\subsection{Pure and mixed states: the density matrix formalism}
First of all, it is useful consider another formalism in addition to that used normally for handling pure states, i.e. states that can be described by a single wave function. We now introduce the \emph{density matrix} formalism for managing the so-called mixed states, although - as we will see - it can be used also for pure states.

Quantum systems prepared in such a way that their state vector being obtained performing a \emph{maximal measurement}, in the sense that the maximum possible information has been acquired (all values of a complete set of commuting observables have been ascertained), are in a pure state. 

Quantum systems for which the maximum possible information is not available, are said to be in mixed state and are called \emph{statistical mixtures}.

Let us consider a system consisting of an ensemble of N sub-systems $\alpha = 1, 2, \dots , N$. We suppose that every sub-system is in a pure state $\ket{\psi_\alpha}$. Then, we choose a complete set of basis vectors $\ket{n}$, such that $\sum_n \ket{n}\bra{n} = \mathds{1}$. Let us expand the pure states in the basis $\{\ket{n}\}$:
\begin{equation*}
    \ket{\psi_\alpha} = \sum_n c_n^{\alpha}\ket{n},
\end{equation*}
where the coefficients $c_n^{(\alpha)}$ are such that
\begin{equation*}
    \sum_n |c_n^{(\alpha)}|^2 = 1.
\end{equation*}
Now let us consider an observable represented by an operator $A$; its expectation value in the pure state $\psi_\alpha$ is:
\begin{align}
    \braket{A}_\alpha &= \bra{\psi_\alpha}A\ket{\psi_\alpha} \\
                      \label{braket_A}
                      &= \sum_n \sum_{n'} c_{n'}^{(\alpha)*} c_n^{(\alpha)} \bra{n'}A\ket{n} \\
                      &= \sum_n \sum_{n'} \braket{n|\psi_\alpha}\braket{\psi_\alpha|n'} \bra{n'}A\ket{n}.
\end{align}
The average value of A over the ensemble is
\begin{equation}
\label{stat_averageA}
    \braket{A} = \sum_{\alpha = 1}^N w_\alpha \langle A \rangle_\alpha,
\end{equation}
where the coefficients $w_\alpha$ are the statistical weight of the pure states $\ket{\psi_\alpha}$, i.e. the probability of finding the system in this state. 
So the $w_\alpha$ are such that
\begin{equation}
\label{charact_weights}
    0 \leq w_\alpha \leq 1
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation*}
    \sum_{\alpha=1}^N w_\alpha = 1.
\end{equation*}
Using the result~\ref{braket_A} in the~\ref{stat_averageA}, we obtain:
\begin{align}
    \braket{A} &= \sum_{\alpha = 1}^N \sum_n \sum_{n'} w_\alpha c_{n'}^{(\alpha)*} c_n^{(\alpha)} \bra{n'}A\ket{n} \\
                \label{total_stat_average}
               &= \sum_{\alpha = 1}^N \sum_n \sum_{n'} \braket{n|\psi_\alpha}w_\alpha \braket{\psi_\alpha|n'} \bra{n'}A\ket{n}.
\end{align}
We now introduce the \emph{density operator}
\begin{equation}
    \rho = \sum_{\alpha = 1}^N \ket{\psi_\alpha} w_\alpha \bra{\psi_\alpha},
\end{equation}
whose representation in the basis $\{n\}$ gives us the density matrix:
\begin{equation}
    \rho_{nn'} = \bra{n}\rho\ket{n'} = \sum_{\alpha = 1}^N w_\alpha c_{n'}^{(\alpha)*} c_n^{(\alpha)}.
\end{equation}
So, returning to the~\ref{total_stat_average} in the definition of the density matrix, we observe that:
\begin{equation*}
    \braket{A} = \sum_n \sum_{n'} \bra{n}\rho\ket{n'}\bra{n'}A\ket{n} = \Tr({\rho A}).
\end{equation*}
It is worth stressing the fact that the knowledge of the density matrix enables us to obtain the ensemble average of A.

Anyway, this leads us to the first of the three fundamental characteristics of the density matrix, that is:
\begin{equation}
    \Tr(\rho) = 1,
\end{equation}
that is true if we make the assumption that the $\ket{\psi_\alpha}$ are normalized to unity. If they are not, then the ensemble average of A is given by
\begin{equation}
    \braket{A} = \frac{\Tr(\rho A)}{\Tr(\rho)}.
\end{equation}
The second characteristic of the density matrix is that it is Hermitian, namely
\begin{equation}
    \bra{n}\rho\ket{n'} = \bra{n'}\rho\ket{n}^*.
\end{equation}
The third characteristic arises from the observation of the diagonal elements of $\rho$:
\begin{equation}
    \rho_{nn} = \bra{n}\rho\ket{n} = \sum_{\alpha = 1}^N w_\alpha |c_{n}^{(\alpha)}|^2,
\end{equation}
which tells us, with the~\ref{charact_weights}, that
\begin{equation}
    \rho_{nn} \geq 0,
\end{equation}
i.e. $\rho$ is a positive semi-definite matrix.
It is worth stress the physical interpretation of the diagonal elements; $w_\alpha$ is the probability of finding the system in the pure state $\psi_\alpha$, while $|c_{n}^{(\alpha)}|^2$ is the probability of finding $\psi_\alpha$ in the state $\ket{n}$. So, $\rho_{nn}$ gives the probability of finding a member of the ensemble in the state $\ket{n}$.

\subsection{Closed Quantum Systems}
\label{closed_systems}
Quantum mechanics establishes that the time evolution of a state vector $\ket{\psi(t)}$ is predicted by the Schr√∂dinger equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:schrod_eq}
    i\frac{d}{dt}\ket{\psi(t)} = H(t)\ket{\psi(t)},
\end{equation}
where $H(t)$ is the Hamiltonian of the closed system and Planck's constant $\hbar$ has been set equal to 1.
The solution of this equation can be written in terms of the unitary time-evolution operator $U(t, t_0)$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:schrod_u}
    \ket{\psi(t)} = U(t, t_0)\ket{\psi(t_0)},
\end{equation}
where $t_0 < t$. If we substitute the equation~\ref{eqn:schrod_u} into the~\ref{eqn:schrod_eq}, we obtain:
\begin{equation}
    i\frac{d}{dt}U(t, t_0) = H(t)U(t, t_0),
\end{equation}
subject to the initial condition
\begin{equation}
    U(t_0, t_0) = \mathds{1}.
\end{equation}
We can write the dynamics of a closed system using the density matrix formalism seen in the previous section. In order to do this, let us assume that at a initial time $t_0$ the state of the system is characterized by the density matrix
\begin{equation*}
    \rho(t_0) = \sum_{\alpha = 1}^N w_\alpha \ket{\psi_\alpha(t_0)} \bra{\psi_\alpha(t_0)},
\end{equation*}
that at a time $t$ evolves in this way:
\begin{equation*}
    \rho(t) = \sum_{\alpha = 1}^N w_\alpha U(t,t_0)\ket{\psi_\alpha(t_0)} \bra{\psi_\alpha(t_0)}U(t,t_0)^\dagger,
\end{equation*}
that is
\begin{equation*}
     \rho(t) = U(t,t_0) \rho(t_0) U(t,t_0)^\dagger.
\end{equation*}
Differentiating with respect to time the last equation we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:motion_closed_dm}
    \frac{d}{dt}\rho(t) = -i[H(t), \rho(t)]
\end{equation}
i.e. an equation of motion for the density matrix, often called the \emph{Liouville-von Neumann equation}.


\subsection{Open Quantum Systems}
Now we can go into a more specific definition of open quantum systems. It can be defined as a system $S$ coupled with another quantum system $E$, called the \emph{environment}. Usually, the total system $S+E$ is treated as a closed system, so it follows Hamiltonian dynamics. The interactions between the two sub-systems cause an evolution in the state of the open system $S$, which can no longer be represented by unitary, Hamiltonian dynamics. Following the definitions given in~\cite{pet_breuer:open_quantum}, an environment with an infinite number of degrees of freedom such that the frequencies of the modes form a continuum, is called \emph{reservoir}. Also, when the reservoir is in thermal equilibrium state, is called \emph{bath}.

Let us call $\mathcal{H}_S$ and $\mathcal{H}_E$ the Hilbert spaces of the system and the environment, respectively. The Hilbert space of the combined system is given by the tensor product $\mathcal{H}_{S+E} = \mathcal{H}_S \otimes \mathcal{H}_E$. So, the total Hamiltonian can be written in this way:
\begin{equation}
    H(t) = H_S \otimes \mathds{1}_E + \mathds{1}_S \otimes H_E + H_I(t),
\end{equation}
where $H_S$ and $H_E$ are the free Hamiltonians of the system and the environment, respectively, and $H_I(t)$ is the Hamiltonian describing the interactions between $S$ and $E$.

At this point, we must find a relation between the density matrix $\rho \in \mathcal{H}$ and $\rho_S \in \mathcal{H}_S$; it is given by the partial trace over the environment $B$\textcolor{red}{[PROOF?]}:
\begin{equation}
    \rho_S = \Tr_E(\rho).
\end{equation}
This can help us in the study of the dynamics of the so-called \emph{reduced} density matrix $\rho_S$. Indeed, we can write:
\begin{equation}
    \rho_S(t) = \Tr_E\{\rho(t)\};
\end{equation}
observing that we assumed the total system to be \emph{closed}, it evolves unitarily so we have:
\begin{equation}
    \rho_S(t) = \Tr_B\{U(t, t_0)\rho(t_0)U(t, t_0)^\dagger\},
\end{equation}
where $U(t, t_0)$ is the time-evolution operator of the combined system $S+E$. So we can use the equation of motion~\ref{eqn:motion_closed_dm} and trace over the degrees of freedom of the environment, in order to obtain the equation of motion for the $\rho_S(t)$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:motion_open}
    \frac{d}{dt}\rho_S(t) = -i \Tr_B[H(t), \rho(t)].
\end{equation}

\section{Approximate Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems}
Since solving exactly the equation~\ref{eqn:motion_open} is rather difficult, because \textcolor{red}{WHY} of the complexity of the environment.

\subsection{Quantum Dynamical Semigroups}
For reasons that will be clear later, let us rewrite the equation~\ref{eqn:motion_open} as a \emph{dynamical map} acting on $\mathcal{H}_S$ that connect the states of the system $S$ from time $t_0$ to time $t_1$, that is:
\begin{equation}
    \matcal{\varepsilon}_{(t_1, t_0)}: \hspace{1cm} \rho_S(t_0) \mapsto \rho_S(t_1).
\end{equation}
In order to obtain the way in which this map acts on the states, we consider a system consisting in two sub-systems $S+E$, that are uncorrelated\textcolor{red}{[FOOTNOTE]} at the initial time $t=0$, so that 
\begin{equation}
    \rho(0) = \rho_S(0) \otimes \rho_E,
\end{equation}
where $\rho_S(0)$ is the initial state of the system $S$, $\rho_E$ represents the state of the environment \textcolor{red}{[QUESTION]}. The evolution of the system $S$ from the time $t=0$ to the time $t>0$ is governed by the map, in this way:
\begin{equation}
    \rho_S(0) \mapsto \rho_S(t) = \matcal{\varepsilon}(t)\rho_S(0) \equiv \Tr_E \{U(t, 0)[\rho_S(0) \otimes \rho_E] U^\dagger(t,0)\}.
\end{equation}
As explained by~\cite{presk:quant_info} \textcolor{red}{[EXPLAIN]}, the dynamical map can be expressed in terms of the following so-called \emph{operator-sum} representation:
\begin{equation}
    \varepsilon(\rho) = \sum_a M_a \rho M_a^\dagger,
\end{equation}
where the $\{M_a\}$ obey the completeness relation
\begin{equation}
\label{compl_rel_kraus}
    \sum_a M_a^\dagger M_a = \mathds{1}
\end{equation}
and are called \emph{Kraus operators}. This object has some essential features that give it the name \emph{trace-preserving completely positive map} or \emph{TPCP map}; as its name suggests, its properties are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item linearity: 
    \begin{equation*}
        \varepsilon(\alpha\rho_1 + \beta\rho_2) = \alpha\varepsilon(\rho_1) + \beta\varepsilon(\rho_2);
    \end{equation*}
    \item preserves Hermiticity: 
    \begin{equation*}
        \rho = \rho^\dagger \implies \varepsilon(\rho) = \varepsilon(\rho)^\dagger;
    \end{equation*}
    \item preserves positivity\footnote{In fact, the map satisfies a stronger property, i.e. it is completely positive; this means that if $\varepsilon$ has an operator-sum representation with Kraus operators $\{M_a\}$, then $\varepsilon \otimes \mathds{1}$ has an operator-sum representation with Kraus operators $\{M_a \otimes \mathds{1}\}$.}:
    \begin{equation*}
        \rho \geq 0 \implies \varepsilon(\rho) \geq 0;
    \end{equation*}
    \item preserves trace:
    \begin{equation*}
        \Tr [\varepsilon(\rho)] = \Tr (\rho).
    \end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
\textcolor{red}{[PROOF?]}

The TPCP maps are called by other names; one of them is \emph{super-operator}, due to its function of connecting operators with operators, rather than vectors with vectors. Another name used in the field of Quantum Information is \emph{quantum channel}, that originates from communication theory and gives the image of the "channel" throughout the state $\rho$ travels to reach its destination as $\varepsilon(\rho)$.

There is a reason why we can say that the TPCP maps form a \emph{dynamical semigroup}: that is because the associative property is satisfied. Indeed, if $\varepsilon_1$ is a TPCP map with $N$ Kraus operators $\{A_a\}$ and $\varepsilon_2$ is a TPCP map with $M$ Kraus operators $\{B_b\}$, than $\varepsilon_1 \circ \varepsilon_2$ has an operator-sum representation with $NM$ Kraus operators $\{A_aB_b\}$.

\subsection{The Markovian Evolution}
With a view to expressing the evolution of the density operator by a differential equation,  let us analyze if the evolution of an open quantum system can be described as a Markovian process\footnote{Let us recall what a Markovian process is: a stochastic process is a Markovian process if the probability that the random variable $X$ takes the value $x_n$ at an arbitrary time $t_n$, is conditioned only by the value $x_{n-1}$ that it took at time $t_{n-1}$ and does not depend on the values at earlier times.}, i.e. \emph{local in time}. The reasons of this lie in the fact that if we want that a (first order) differential equation in $t$ governs the evolution of $\rho(t)$, $\rho(t+dt)$ must be completely determined by $\rho(t)$.

So, a problem emerges: an open system is \emph{dissipative}, in the sense that information can flow from the system into the environment but also can flow back from the environment into the system, causing non-Markovian fluctuations. This fact seems to outdistance the possibility of applying the Markovian model.  A possible solution is neglecting the typical correlation time of the fluctuations respect to the time scale of the evolution that we want to study.

\subsection{The Lindblad Master Equation}
Once we take for granted that the dynamics is Markovian, we can write the evolution for the infinitesimal time interval $dt$:
\begin{equation}
    \rho(t+dt) = \varepsilon_{dt}[\rho(t)].
\end{equation}
Expanding $\varepsilon_{dt}$ to first order, we get:
\begin{equation}
\label{expantion_eps}
    \varepsilon_{dt} = \mathds{1} + dt\mathcal{L},
\end{equation}
and we find
\begin{equation}
    \Dot{\rho} = \mathcal{L}[\rho],
\end{equation}
where the linear map generating time evolution $\mathcal{L}$ is called \emph{Liouvillian} or \emph{Linbladian}. 
The quantum channel~\ref{expantion_eps} has the operator-sum representation
\begin{equation}
\label{op_sum_repr}
    \varepsilon_{dt}[\rho(t)] = \sum_a M_a \rho(t) M_a^\dagger = \rho(t) + \mathcal{O}(dt).
\end{equation}
So we may assume that $M_0 = \mathds{1} + \mathcal{O}(dt)$ and the $M_a$ is of order $\sqrt{dt}$ for $a>0$. In particular, we can write:
\begin{align}
    M_0 &= \mathds{1} + (-iH+K)dt \\
    M_a &= \sqrt{dt}L_a, \hspace{1cm} a = 1,\dots,?
\end{align}
where $H$, $K$ are both hermitian and $L_a$, H, K are zeroth order in $dt$.
Now, we can determine $K$ using the completeness relation~\ref{compl_rel_kraus}:
\begin{align}
    \mathds{1} &= \sum_{a=0}^N M_a^\dagger M_a \\
               &= M_0^\dagger M_0 + \sum_{a=1}^N L_a^\dagger L_a dt \\
               &= \mathds{1} +2Kdt + \sum_{a=1}^N L_a^\dagger L_a dt + \mathcal{O}(dt^2),
\end{align}
so, keeping terms up to linear order in $dt$ we have:
\begin{equation*}
    K = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{a=1}^N L_a^\dagger L_a.
\end{equation*}
Substituting in equation~\ref{op_sum_repr}, we obtain the \emph{Lindblad master equation}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:lindblad_eqn}
    \dot{\rho} = \mathcal{L}[\rho] \equiv -i[H, \rho] - \sum_{a=1}^? \gamma_a \Bigl(\frac{1}{2}L_a^{\dagger}L_a\rho + \frac{1}{2}\rho L_a^{\dagger}L_a - L_a\rho L_a^{\dagger}\Bigl).
\end{equation}
This is the equation that governs the evolution of a quantum system, with the assumption that the evolution is a TPCP map. The non-negative quantities $\gamma_a$ have the dimension of an inverse time and have the physical meaning of dissipation rate.

It is clear that the first term of equation~\ref{eqn:lindblad_eqn} represents the unitary part of the dynamics generated by the Hamiltonian; the second part, instead, describes the possible evolution that the system may endure due to the interaction with the environment. Indeed, the $L_a$ are called \emph{quantum jump operators} or \emph{Lindblad operators}.



\section{Open Many-Body Quantum Systems}
Now we consider the case of open many-body quantum systems, very relevant from the point of view of several physical fields. In this section, we will examine some of the phenomena and tools useful to better understand such systems. For now, let us recall that the Hilbert space of a composite quantum system is the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces of the sub-systems that constitute the system.

\subsection{Schmidt Decomposition and Entanglement}
A very useful tool is the \emph{Schmidt decomposition}, that we present here following the line of reasoning of~\cite{nielsen_chuang}.
\newtheorem{theo}{Theorem}[section]
\begin{theo}
    Let us suppose that $\ket{\Psi}$ is a pure state of a composite system $AB$, that lives in the Hilbert space given by the tensor product $\mathcal{H}_A \otimes \mathcal{H}_B$. Then there exist orthonormal bases, the Schmidt bases, $\{\chi_i^{(A)}\}$ and $\{\chi_j^{(B)}\}$, in $\mathcal{H}_A$ and $\mathcal{H}_B$, respectevely, such that
    \begin{equation}
        \ket{\Psi} = \sum_i \alpha_i \ket{\chi_i^{(A)}}\otimes \ket{\chi_i^{(B)}}.
    \end{equation}
    The $\alpha_i$ are complex numbers called Schmidt coefficients.
\end{theo}
\begin{proof}
Let $\ket{\chi_j}$ and $\ket{\chi_k}$ be orthonormal bases for systems $A$ and $B$, respectevely. So, $\ket{\Psi}$ can be written as $\ket{\Psi} = \sum_{jk} a_{jk}\ket{\chi_j}\ket{\chi_k}$. Using the singular value decomposition, we can write the matrix $a$ constituted by the elements $a_{jk}$, in this way: $a = udv$, where $d$ is a diagonal matrix with non-negative elements, $u$ and $v$ are unitary matrices. So we have $\ket{\Psi} = \sum_{ijk} u_{ji}d_{ii}v_{ik} \ket{\chi_j}\ket{\chi_k}$.
Defining $\ket{\chi_i^{(A)}} \equiv \sum_j u_{ji}\ket{chi_j}$, $\ket{\chi_i^{(B)}} \equiv \sum_k v_{ik}\ket{chi_k}$ and $\alpha_i \equiv d_{ii}$, we get $\ket{\Psi} = \sum_i \alpha_i \ket{\chi_i^{(A)}}\otimes \ket{\chi_i^{(B)}}$.
\end{proof}
